# SVM
This is a project that I worked on in my machine learning class during Spring 2023 at Tufts University, in which I implemented a support vector machine from scratch.

## Files below:

- implementation.py:
    - This file contains the implementation of all functions necessary for our SVM.

- notebook.ipynb:
    - This notebook contains the implementation of the SVM, along with notes explaining the process.
