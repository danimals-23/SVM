# SVM
Implementation of a support vector machine from scratch

This is a project that I worked on in my machine learning class during Spring 2023 at Tufts University.

Files:
  implementation.py -
      This file contains the implementation of all functions necessary for our SVM.

  notebook.ipynb -
      This notebook contains the implementation of the SVM, along with notes explaining the process.
